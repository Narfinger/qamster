qamster
=======

A hamster replacement in Qt or google app engine!

# Versions:
- Qt Version (cpp)
- App Engine v1 (go-appengine)
- App Engine v2 (rust/backend)

# Information about the rust
I rewrote the same thing in rust now with a backend and frontend. No web interface. This is the most recent work and runs on the custom app engine environment in google app engine (aka docker). Some things might not be optimal yet but depending on time I will work on it.

# Why?
Well, I tried to add a feature to hamster but this needed to be installed to test it. So I thought I could just write it new.
And as I anyway use Qt it would be nicely integrated in my DE.

# But KTimeTracker?
KTimeTracker (when I last checked) didn't have the ease of starting a new task as Hamster. It takes less than a second to start in
Hamster thanks to autocompletion.

# What is up with the name?
We clearly needed to reference hamster and needed a Q somewhere in there. I also like names that are prone to be misspronounced. Do you
pronounce it like Quamster? QHamster?

# Why google app engine/go/angularjs
I wanted to learn all these new technologies and I started to use more than one system but still wanted to keep track of time spent.
