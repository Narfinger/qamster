qamster
=======

A hamster replacement in Qt or google app engine!

# Why?
Well, I tried to add a feature to hamster but this needed to be installed to test it. So I thought I could just write it new.
And as I anyway use Qt it would be nicely integrated in my DE.

# But KTimeTracker?
KTimeTracker (when I last checked) didn't have the ease of starting a new task as Hamster. It takes less than a second to start in
Hamster thanks to autocompletion.

# What is up with the name?
We clearly needed to reference hamster and needed a Q somewhere in there. I also like names that are prone to be misspronounced. Do you
pronounce it like Quamster? QHamster?

# Why google app engine/go/angularjs
I wanted to learn all these new technologies and I started to use more than one system but still wanted to keep track of time spent.
